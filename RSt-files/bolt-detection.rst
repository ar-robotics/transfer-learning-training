bolt_detection
===============

This is a jupyter notebook that uses the pipeline called media_pipe to detect bolts with a camera.
The dataset was created with OpenCV and the images were labelled and annotated with Roboflow. It was then converted 
to Pascal VOC format and used to train a model with the media_pipe pipeline. It was exported to a float 32 tflite model.
