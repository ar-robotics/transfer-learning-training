people-detection
================

This is a jupyter notebook that uses the pipeline media_pipe to train a model to detect people in real-time. 
The dataset is taken from an open-source dataset from Roboflow. It was then converted to Pascal VOC format and used to train the model. 
We used the COCO dataset to train the model.
